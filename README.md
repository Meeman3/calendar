# Daily Organiser

My (hopefully) personal daily organiser. 
My first time working with GUI and tkinter and first proper solo project.

## Requiremets:

    - Python 3.x
    - tkinter (some systems come with this, linux may need to do it manually)
    - python3-dateutil

## How to clone and run

To run this organiser on your pc, do the following:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    In your terminal run the command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Meeman3/Daily-organiser.git
    ```

2. **Change to organiser directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Daily-organiser
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    You will need python3, tkinter and dateutil. The following command are for ubuntu since thats what i use
    
    *python3*
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python3
    ```

    *tkinter*
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python3-tk
    ```
