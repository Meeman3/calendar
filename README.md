# Daily Organiser

My (hopefully) personal daily organiser. 
My first time working with GUI and tkinter and first proper solo project.

## How to clone and run

To run this organiser on your pc, do the following:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    In your terminal run the command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Meeman3/Daily-organiser.git


To use this you will need python3, tkinter (if your python doesn't come with it) and dateutil python extensions.

Simply clone the repository then
